# hledger-getquotes

An add-on tool for the hledger program which allows one to easily download stock quotes.  hledger-getquotes downloads the most recent closing prices for all of the stocks included in your hledger file.

example usage: hledger getquotes -f ~/ledger.journal -o ~/prices.db

The above command will download all of the most recent closing prices for any stocks included in the ~/myjournal.ledger file and will save them to the ~/prices.db file.


Note: hledger does not currently report asset values based on current stock prices, but this functionality is planned for a future release.  ledger-cli does support this functionality and the prices generated by hledger-quotes can be used for this purpose.

exemple: ledger -f ~/myledger.journal bal --price-db ~/.hquotes.db -V

The above command will show the balance of all accounts with stock assets reported by value rather than by number of shares.
